# Data Science: identifying customer segments
## Project 3
Jesse Fredrickson

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to read in census data on a target population, and compare it with existing customer census data from an example company with the goal of identifying customer segments in the new market. I initially read in the data from .csv files, with pandas, then perform cleaning/preprocessing, perform feature scaling and PCA, and finally perform clustering on the target and existing market data. 

## Files
**identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb:** This is the main file in which I perform my analysis in python.
**identify_Customer_Segments.html:** Since the original data files for this project are no longer available due to proprietary reasons, my analysis is not repeatable. This .html file contains all of the results of my work for review.
**pca.joblib:** a saved state of a pca object to save load in the future

## Results / Instructions
I have discarded the original .csv files associated with this project as they were sensitive in nature. However, my results are viewable in the .html file in this repo. I was able to successfully segregate prominent population features into 6 categories, and compare them with their representations from the customer dataset, establishing where the company should target its efforts, and also revealing how its customers relate to the general population.

Although my specific work is unrepeatable, using the code in th
