# Data Science: identifying customer segments
## Project 3
Jesse Fredrickson

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to read in census data on a target population, and compare it with existing customer census data from an example company with the goal of identifying customer segments in the new market. I initially read in the data from .csv files, with pandas, then perform cleaning/preprocessing, perform feature scaling and PCA, and finally perform clustering on the target and existing market data. 

## Files
**identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb:** This is the main file in which I perform my analysis in python
